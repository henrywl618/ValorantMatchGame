# Matching Card Game

This is a matching card game based on characters (called agents in the game) from the video game Valorant.

Click on a facedown card to flip and reveal an agent and click on another facedown card to see if its a matching agent. 

Difficulty level starts at 5 matching pairs all the way up to 19 matching pairs. The difficulty names are correlated with ranks that are obtainable in the video game in increasing order of difficulty from Iron to Radiant.

High Scores for each difficulty are stored in local storage.
